Question:

Write our the basic pseudocode for Uniform-Cost Search.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Closed List to hold explored nodes

Create Open List to hold know, yet unexplored nodes

Create Goal and set to bool False

Create Resign and set to bool False

Create Cost to hold # of times through the while loop (# of expansions done), and initialize to 0


Start @ Start Point

While not @ Goal and not Resign

   Add current node to closed list

   If you have more open nodes continue, else Resign to True and break

   If current cell is the location of the goal, set Goal to True and break 

   Else:

          +1 cost value

         Search open list for smallest cost value

         Expand that node by searching all unexplored, valid neighbors dependent on allowed movement directions

         Add all expanded nodes to open list while writing the current cost value into each node expanded this round

         


Proof:

See Search video # 9
